## Getting Started

The Tic Tac Toe Game is a Python command-line application that allows one player to play the classic Tic Tac Toe game against a computer. It features a simple and interactive interface for an enjoyable gaming experience.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Play Tic Tac Toe with a friend in a turn-based fashion. Each player takes turns to make their move.

- **Clear Board Display**: The game provides a clean and easy-to-read representation of the game board, allowing players to see the current state of the game at a glance.

- **Win Detection**: The game automatically detects when a player has won the game and announces the winner.

- **Tie Detection**: The game checks for a tie when the board is full, and it declares the game as a tie if neither player wins.

- **Computer Opponent**: The game includes a computer opponent that you can play against. The computer opponent makes strategic moves to challenge you.

## Usage

1. Run the tic_tac_toe.py script to start the game.
2. Players take turns to input their moves by specifying the row (0, 1, or 2) and the column (0, 1, or 2) where they want to place their symbol.
3. The game will automatically detect the winner or announce a tie when the game ends.
